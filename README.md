# Frontend CRUD in VUE

> A Vue.js project intended for entering www.harbourshare.com, using bootstrap 4, a little of JQuery for the fade animation in the loading overlay and basically connected with a flask project that stores data in firebase, both projects are connected to google build and thus google run for quick deployment.

This particular project was configured to have a sub domain of my own.

Sorry for any mess in the code, hope you like this!
